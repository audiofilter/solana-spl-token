A Solana Reflection Token is an SPL token that automatically redistributes a percentage of each transaction to all token holders. Unlike traditional staking, there's no need to lock up tokensâ€”just hold and earn!


## Features
- Auto Rewards-Passive income for token holders
- Gas Efficient- Built for Solana's high-speed transactions
- Decentralized & Secure - Powered by Rust & Anchor
- Deflationary  Mechanism- Reduce supply over time
- Liquidity Boosting- Option to add auto-liquidity

## How It Works

- User sends tokens-A smalll percentage is taxed
- Tax is redistributed among all token holders
- Holders atomatically earn rewards in real-time

## Smart Contract Overview

- Reflection Distribution - Auto-redistribution to all holders
- Transaction Tax - Configurable percentage for reflections
- Liquidity Auto-Addition - Optional LP boosting
- Burn Mechanism - Deflationary tokenomics

## Use Cases

## Project Organization

- `programs/`: Contains all Solana on-chain programs written in Rust
- `src/`: Client-side TypeScript/JavaScript code
  - `clients/`: API clients and service integrations
  - `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities
  - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `constants/`: Configuration and constants
